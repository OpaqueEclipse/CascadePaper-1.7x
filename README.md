Basic 1.7 Paper Fork for Nostalgic Combat (Not production safe)

you'll need git, maven, jdk8, and tolerance for really shitty code structuring if you wan't to use this

Credits to OCN for the relog fix and knockback command, and credits to prplz for the bug fixes related to entity tracking, and mojang for craftbukkit /bukkit, and minecraft itself (obviously)

(DO NOT USE THIS FOR A PRODUCTION SERVER, IT IS NOT ONLY UNSAFE (No server exploits are fixed in this, including Log4Shell) BUT IT IS NOT OPTIMIZED HARDLY AT ALL SO IT WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SUSTAIN HIGH PLAYER COUNTS) 

 I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE IF YOU IGNORE THE WARNING AND EITHER MAKE A LAGGY SERVER OR IN THE WORST CASE SCENARIO GET AFFECTED BY ANY KNOWN EXPLOITS

Thanks! ~ Fourt
